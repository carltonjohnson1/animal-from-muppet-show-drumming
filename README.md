# Animal Drum kit

## Welcome!

Thanks for checking out this this Animal from the muppet show drum kit project.

This was completed as part of a class project in a short course I did with [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/students/courses/front-end-web-development-short-course/london).

This project was focused on getting the javaScript to work currently so that pressing the keys resulted in the right sounds playing. We didn't have to design the page, that was already done for us, we just had to get the JavaScript working. The page was not responsive, though, so I had to make it responsive by adding an appropriate breakpoint for tablet and mobile. 

## What happens

The following is what happens on specific keypresses.

1. When user `keydown` letter <kbd>A</kbd> **clap** sound is heard
